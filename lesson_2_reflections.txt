How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	staging area is like purgatory. I think it should have been called
that instead. hehe

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	-->$ git diff, to compare cwd and staging and check for only one '+' or '-'

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	-->$ create new branch for every US

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure? 
	--> where the branches meet
