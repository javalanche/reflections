When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	working with other people, cloud benefits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	the code in repo could break something you are working on. how would
	it know what to update if you are working on changes to those files?
