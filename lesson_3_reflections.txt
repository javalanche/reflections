When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	working with other people, cloud benefits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	the code in repo could break something you are working on. how would
	it know what to update if you are working on changes to those files?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork: copy of branch on my GitHub account
	clone: copy of branch on my local machine
	branch: a string of commits that has lead to the present state of project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	can always revert back to it if you mess up something and don't want to take the time to finish it

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	i believe the Q implies not using a tool like git or github. Yes it
	would be harder cause have to do all this stuff manually now
